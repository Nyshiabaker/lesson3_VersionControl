            <p class="lead">VCS also known as version control system is a very helpful system to have when building a website. Version control is a component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.  It also ecords changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  Also GIT is version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. This interest me and is important to the class because I didn’t know that GIT was a version control system and a lot of others don’t know.

            <p class="lead">GIT is version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.It also racks changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.Nearly every development environment has Git support and Git command line tools run on every major operating system.The above statement is why this is important to the class because Git is on every major operating system. This topic interests me because I hope to actually use git in the future in my
                career. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. GitHub is the service for projects that use Git. It also hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. This is important because this system allows us to use the git commands for class. This topic interest me because again I never really knew about these tools before this class and never knew the difference between the two system. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With Git there comes many different commands with different meanings that you will need to use to connect it to other services like cloud9 and other terminals. The first git command I will discuss is git config which is the command to set the author name and email address respectively to be used with your commits. In this exact assignment we needed to do this step in order to use the other commands or it would come up with an error. The next one is git init, this command is used to start a new repository. This topic interested me because it’s so many shortcuts to do things that would take a long time to do otherwise and it examples are really easy to learn and follow. This is important because this topic is needed to use GitHub which is used to share your projects with other people. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The use of the Git Respitorary is it being a working tree, staging area, and Git directory. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer. The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project.You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways: You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere. This is important to me because this topic is needed to use GitHub which is used to share projects with other people and employers. This is important to the class because we need to create a respiratory in order to do certain assignments and fully connect our cloud9 with our Github. </p>
